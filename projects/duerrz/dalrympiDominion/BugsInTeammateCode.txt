######Bug Report 1 - dominion.c:754 int fSmithy(int, int, gameState*)######
Title: Player hand count is incorrect after playing the Smithy card
Date: 9/5/17
Priority: High
Version: Assignment-2 branch of dalrympi’s dominion fork
Platform: macOS Sierra 10.12.6
Is the bug reproducible?:  Yes
Method used to identify the bug: Ran cardtest2.c and randomtestcard1.c unit test functions

Steps to reproduce:
- Initialize the game to any valid state
- Assure the player in question has a smithy card in their hand
- Record the hand count of the player with the smithy card
- Call the fSmithy function passing the appropriate variables
- Record the appropriate player hand count after calling the smithy card
Expected Results:
The player hand count increase my 2 when the Smithy card is played because 3 cards are drawn to the player card and the Smithy card is discarded.
 
Actual Results: 
The player hand count is increased by 3 when the Smithy card is played

Potential Cause:
The off by one error in player hand count may be cause by the player drawing 4 cards rather than 3 and properly discarding the Smithy card or the player is drawing 3 cards and not discarding the Smithy.  The unit tests indicate that the player is drawing 4 cards since the Smithy Discarded test passes.

Suggested Fix:
Review the code where the player cards are drawn in the fsmithy function to check for an off by one error in how many cards are drawn.

######Bug Report 2 - dominion.c:771 int fVillage(int, int, gameState*)######
Title: The wrong player has a card discarded from their hand when village is played
Date: 9/5/17
Priority: High
Version: Assignment-2 branch of dalrympi’s dominion fork
Platform: macOS Sierra 10.12.6
Is the bug reproducible?:  Yes
Method used to identify the bug: Ran randomtestcard2.c unit test functions

Steps to reproduce:
- Initialize the game to any valid state
- Assure the player 0 has a village card in their hand
- Assure player 1 has at least 2 cards in thier hand
- Assure that the village card in player 0’s hand is at position 1 in the player’s hand.
- Record the cards currently in player 0 and player 1’s hands
- Call the fVillage function passing the appropriate variables
- Compare the cards currently in player 0 and player 1’s hand to prior to calling the village function
- Note that player 1 has a different hand even though player 0 played the card

Expected Results:
Player 0 plays the Village card and the Village card should be removed from player 0’s hand
 
Actual Results: 
Player 1 has a card removed from their hand

Potential Cause:
The discard function called in village may have an error where the wrong player integer is used as a parameter for the function call

Suggested Fix:
Review the code where the discard function is called and make sure the correct player is being passed as a parameter.  Double check the discard function parameter list to make sure the function is being used properly in the village function.
